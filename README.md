# Meaning OS × Blockchain — Implementation Example A

This project represents **an implementation example of the OS Control Unit**  
described in the patent application *"Non-Continuous Jump Control Type Meaning Generation OS"*.

In this implementation:
- The **Emotion Resonance Function** (broadly defined evaluation function)  
  and **Meaning Energy Function** are computed off-chain to generate  
  `Δφ` (state improvement measure) and jump direction `g`.
- These results are irreversibly recorded via a **Commit–Reveal structure**.
- Only when the **Non-Continuous Jump Condition** is satisfied  
  (`Δφ < 0` and no challenges during the OCW period) is the reference point updated  
  on-chain and the jump finalized.
- The **Γ-floor mechanism** allows **extension of the OCW period** based on  
  minority approval, ensuring sufficient time before reference point updates.

Through this approach, we realize the **OS Control Unit** described in Claims 1–4  
of the patent in a decentralized ledger environment, enabling socially verifiable control.


## Feature–Patent Element Mapping

- **Emotion Resonance Function E(s)** — Broadly defined evaluation value (`Δφ`)  
  computed externally and recorded via commit/reveal
- **Meaning Energy Function Φ(s)** — Semantic energy evaluation of state vector `s` (off-chain)
- **Non-Continuous Jump Condition** — `Δφ < 0` + no challenges → finalize
- **Reference Point Update ψ_ref** — Performed at finalize
- **OS Control Unit** — The complete process of commit / reveal / finalize / Γ-floor / OCW extension
